                    <p>At Ekota we have not taken a selective approach to those who join our club and football activities.   We have encouraged young people with no sporting abilities, varying physical levels and from challenging backgrounds to become involved and participate. This aligns to our central mission statement and approach to maximise participation in sport for all.     </p>
